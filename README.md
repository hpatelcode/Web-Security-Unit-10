A honeypot is a decoy application, server, or other networked resource that purposely exposes vulnerabilities in order to lure attackers and gain insight on the techniques they utilize. Honeypots are commonly used by security researchers to understand the threats and techniques that are used to exploit vulnerabilities. This information can be used to get:

->Information about sources of malicious network traffic such as IP addresses, geographic origin, targeted ports, etc.

->Avoiding email spammers

->Malware 

->Database vulnerabilities such as SQLI techniques/injections
